# Wisdom Nuggets

A lightweight collection of small insights, reminders, and gotchas I’ve learned the hard way while coding.  
Think of it as a **Hitchhiker's guide of "wish-I-knew-that-earlier" notes**.

## What’s inside
- Quick tips that might save time  
- Common mistakes and their fixes  
- Handy patterns and shortcuts  
- Nuggets of general programming wisdom  

## Why this repo exists
While trying to get up to speed I made some oversights that got corrected by my friend Simon. (Thanks Simon for correcting (: ) Instead of relearning them every time and not saving Simon some time and sanity, I wrote them down.  
Now they live here—so future me (and maybe you) can avoid the same pitfalls.

## How to use
Browse, copy, adapt.  
If even one nugget saves you 10 minutes, it’s done its job.
